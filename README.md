## Instructions:
Write a function that takes a number, ```max```, and returns the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers less than ```max```

## Explanation:
The Fibonacci Sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers in the sequence, where the first two numbers are 1 and 2. The first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence are:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89

### Solution walk through:
* Create a Fibonacci class
* Have a method called ```fibonacci generator``` that is passed ```max```, and that will generate a Fibonacci sequence of numbers up to max
* Create an ```even_sum``` method that will return the sum of all of the even numbers less than ```max```.
